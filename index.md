Welcome, welcome! Round up for a tale or two from the infosec+electronics dungeon. Or maybe not.

This doesn't aim to be any sort of a reliable source of verified information -- it's just a collection of notes I thought might be useful for someone else doing the same stuff.

As always, whatever you do with information you found here, it's all on you. Don't blame me for it!
