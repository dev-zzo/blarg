Hey sup. For a change, I thought I'd write a long post, and this is the one. Today (?) I will look at Siemens M127C2, another memory card which was used in payphones, cash cards, etc.

All silicon images were taken [from here](https://siliconpr0n.org/archive/doku.php?id=infosecdj:siemens:m127-c2) for those playing along at home.

Yeah, the M1327 turned out a bit too complicated for my level yet, so hopefully this will be an easier target lol.

## Pinout and die layout

To start with, here is the lay of the land.

![Die layout, showing pins and some of the blocks](/blarg/assets/20240804/die-markup.jpg)

The 8 pads in blue are marked C1 through C8, like they are named in the ISO 7816 standard.

| Pad | Function | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
|  C1 | VDD | Power supply to the chip, +5V nom. |
|  C2 | ? | RST in ISO, R/W elsewhere |
|  C3 | CLK | Clock supply |
|  C4 | ? | RFU/FCB in ISO, RST elsewhere |
|  C5 | VSS | Power supply to the chip, 0V |
|  C6 | VPP | Programming voltage |
|  C7 | I/O | Bidirectional data line |
|  C8 | ? | RFU in ISO, Fuse elsewhere |

I used [this page](http://matthieu.weber.free.fr/electronique/cartes_a_puces/index.html) for the "elsewhere" source. Whether this specimen actually conforms to any of this info remains to be seen...

Other that that, there is the memory array in yellow and its support circuitry in orange. The rest of the die is taken by a variety of digital and mixed NMOS circuitry and wiring. Notably, this device does not allow poly crossing diffusion without forming a transistor; will make the reverse engineering a bit easier compared to the M1327.

## Pin circuitry

Starting with the obvious here. Let's have a look at each non-power pin and try to see what's going on.

# Pin C2

Probably one of the simplest input circuits here, here is its schematic. Very similar themes with upside-down inverters and split transistors to what I've seen on M1327; I wonder if the same team worked on both designs.

And its schematic:

Not sure what exactly does Q1 achieve here. Q2 pulls the pin up. Then there is a chain of two inverters, Q3/4/5 and Q6/7, putting the true value of the input pin out.

The question remains on the role of Q8/9/10; they seem to be forming something with an open-drain output but as to what it does and why it is there, I hope I will be able to figure it out later on.

# Pin C3: CLK

This circuit is way more complicated, although it builds on the same design.

And its schematic:

![Pin C3 schematics](/blarg/assets/20240804/pin-c3-schematic.png)

In fact, this is exactly the same as [seen before in M1327](/blarg/2024/07/30/siemens-m1327a3-part-7.html). The only difference is, the raw pin connection is also used in this design.

# Pin C4

OK, I was wrong. This one is now the simplest input circuit.

And its schematic:

The pin drives only one input inside some logic blob; I imagine this is why it is lacking all the fancy inverter action other pins have.

There are two big questions (heh) regarding the layout -- obviously something is/was there, but I can't figure out what. It sure looks like it was connected with two poly sheets to those chonky transistors, but poly is not there any more, and no sign of it being vapourised either.
