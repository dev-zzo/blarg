Hullo, it's been a REAL while since the last post. Sorry, that's how it is.

Today I'll be writing down some thoughts on a Siemens M1327, specifically revision A3. I thought, as I have multiple samples of this device, I'd try my hand at reverse engineering it. The chip went through multiple revisions; I have seen [A2](https://siliconpr0n.org/archive/doku.php?id=infosecdj:siemens:m1327a2) and A3 and would love to see A1. Moreover, this design seems to come after [M127](https://siliconpr0n.org/archive/doku.php?id=infosecdj:siemens:m127-c2) which implements "similar" functionality.

All images are sourced from [here](https://siliconpr0n.org/archive/doku.php?id=infosecdj:siemens:m1327a3).

There are two obvious memory arrays on the device. The top one is 17 columns by 16 rows, the bottom one is 14 columns by 16 rows. 

# Device basics

This is a [depletion-mode NMOS device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depletion-load_NMOS_logic) using polysilicon gates. Unlike CMOS, it only has N-channel transistors (duh) -- with a basic building block like this:

Which translates to this (least obscured) layout on the die:

The input is a poly wire going in from the left, creating a small N-ch transistor connected to a much larger one on top. The output is again a poly wire, notably as a continuation of the pull-up NMOS transistor gate.

In NMOS circuits that aren't built from standard cells, it is paramount to be able to distinguish between transistors and everything else e.g. polysilicon wires crossing a diffusion.

Here, we have poly wires (kinda reddish gray?) crossing a diffusion (here normally cool gray) without forming a transistor. Note the small lines on the sides; note the absence of the same on unmarked crossings.

# A worked example

Let's try reverse engineering this gate:

Immediately, two pull-up transistors are present, as well as several normal NMOS devices. Black rectanges are contact points from the metal layer to the diffusion layer. Here is a tentative markup of what's going on:

Putting this carefully into KiCad:

...and if I didn't make any stupid mistakes (happens!) -- this appears to be a XOR gate.

More to follow. Until then!

UPDATE: As it was pointed out, the load transistors should be depletion-mode (solid line instead of dashed).

UPDATE 2: [Part 2](/blarg/2024/07/23/siemens-m1327-part-2.html) has arrived.
