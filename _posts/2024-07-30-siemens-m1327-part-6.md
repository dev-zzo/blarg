Hola! I shall continue the reverse engineering exploits against Siemens M1327A3 today, and this time I will have a look at the final 3rd counter on the die.

![TFF chain locations on the die, numbered 1 to 3](/blarg/assets/20240725/tff-chain-locations.jpg)

This chain has 10 T flip-flop (TFF) sections plus some more circuitry around them; one is directly above (red) and connected to the outputs and the other is to the right (yellow). Just like the other two.

Let's put the flip-flops and their output transistors on the schematic:

![Chain 3 starting schematic](/blarg/assets/20240730/counter-3-schematic-1.png)

The transistors make up two NOR gates; the ones connected to the top line result in H when the count is `01000_00000`, the bottom ones give H when the count is `11111_11111`. Note that all outputs are also routed outside the unit.

Sketching out the rest of the red box circuitry...

(A few hours later) I have drawn "the rest of the owl" = what was in the yellow box.

And a diagram of component/wire placement:

And after much moving and redrawing, here is the all-in-one schematic of this unit:

Yes, I discovered I can label the gates with transistors they are formed with. I should redo all the other unit schematics in this style...

# Analysis

The clock generation stuff is [already known circuitry](/blarg/2024/07/25/siemens-m1327-part-4.html). Thanks to that, I could mark `X7` as `CLK` without investigating further. Same goes for `CLR`. But the way this signal is generated warrants further investigation.

`X6` looks like an asynchronous clear input; will clear the flip-flop chain independent of anything. Otherwise, gate Q46/47 will synchronise the clear signal to the `CLK` high.

Gate Q28/29/30 outputs L when either of the signals generated with those massive NORs is H.

```
Y = !((CNT == 0b01000_00000 & !X1) + (CNT == 0b11111_11111 & !X2 & X3))

Y = !(CNT == 0b01000_00000 & !X1) & !(CNT == 0b11111_11111 & !X2 & X3)
```

The whole chain Q28 through Q33 outputs this:

```
Y = X5 & X4 & !(CNT == 0b01000_00000 & !X1) & !(CNT == 0b11111_11111 & !X2 & X3)

Y = !(!X5 + !X4 + (CNT == 0b01000_00000 & !X1) + (CNT == 0b11111_11111 & !X2 & X3))
```

The output is active low; it goes low when `X5` or `X4` is low or one of the counter values is matched (plus more condition inputs...). The rest of the circuit is identical to what's seen in [part 4](/blarg/2024/07/25/siemens-m1327-part-4.html), though this time I drew the flip-flop properly.

Now that chip deprocessing was successful, I can look further at what happens with this counter outputs. Let's do that next time. Until then!
